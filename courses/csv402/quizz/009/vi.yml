question: On RGB, why is it recommended to use Tapret instead of Opret for commitments?
answer: To minimize visibility and avoid censorship
wrong_answers:
  - To reduce transaction costs
  - Because an OP_RETURN is not Lightning-compatible
  - To maximize the size of commitments
explanation: |
  Tapret lets you integrate commitments discreetly, unlike OP_RETURN, which makes them immediately visible and subject to censorship.
