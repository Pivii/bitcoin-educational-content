question: What is the fundamental concept behind the RGB protocol?
answer: Customer-side validation via on-chain cryptographic commitments
wrong_answers:
  - On-chain validation by Turing-complete smart contracts
  - Exclusive use of unencrypted Bitcoin transactions
  - Contract execution on a blockchain dedicated to smart contracts
explanation: |
  RGB is based on a client-side validation model where commitments (via Taproot or OP_RETURN) are entered on-chain, while most of the logic and data is kept off-chain.
